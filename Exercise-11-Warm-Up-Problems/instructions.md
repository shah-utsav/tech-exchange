# Instructions  

Solve these problems in order, writing at least 3 test cases for each one.

You can put all of your test cases in main.py, or in each individual file. By uncommenting the import statements in main.py, you can have the green Run button run whichever file you want!

## Problem 1 - Vowels
Given a word as input, return True if the word contains a vowel; False otherwise.

```python
Examples:
word='hello' → True
word='fly' → False
word='myth' → False
word='google' → True
```

## Problem 2 - Average Length
Given a list of words, find the average word length.

```python
Examples:
words=['Google', 'Tech', 'Exchange'] → 6
words=['She', 'Sells', 'Sea', 'Shells'] → 4.25
```

## Problem 3 - Reverse String
Given a string as input, return a reversed version of it.

```python
Examples:
s='xyz' → 'zyx'
s='google' → 'elgoog'
```

## Problem 4 - Number Count
A list of all the integers from 0 to n is shuffled so they are no longer in order. Count how many integers appear earlier in the list than they should.

```python
Examples:
nums=[2,1,3,0] → 2
nums=[1,2,3,0] → 3
nums=[0,1,2] → 0
```
